No more of that number everyone loves to spam these days.\
Y'know, the one you get from doing  `69 - 2`  (referred to as <cy>*The Number*</c>, or <cr>"The Two Digits"</c> in mod settings).

Bans ~~all~~ most instances of the number you get from doing  `69 - 2`  , as well as <cy>*The Number*</c>'s individual digits.

Places where <cy>*The Number*</c> may be banned include:
- Player X/Y position or current level percentage/timer time
- Level IDs, names, or star/moon ratings
- Level List IDs, names, diamond reward count, or completion requirements
- Account profiles, their specific stats, or their global rank
- Your icon kit (based on your own stats)

Want to have stricter rules? <cy>*The Number*</c> may also be banned in:
- Levels using object IDs, group IDs, editor layer IDs, or color channel IDs containing <cy>*The Number*</c> anywhere
- Any place that displays text
